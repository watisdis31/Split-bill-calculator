# 🍔 Easy Bill Calculator

Because someone *always* forgets how much they owe for that boba tea from 3 days ago.

**Easy Bill Calculator** helps you split restaurant bills fairly:
- foods & drinks
- quantities
- service charge & tax
- discounts (before / after tax)
- and most importantly… **who owes how much**

All without Excel, calculators, or awkward group chat debates.

## 🤝 Why We Made This

Because:
- Group bills are annoying
- Someone *always* underpays
- “I'll pay you back once I'm home” is a lie

This makes the split **transparent, fair, and fast**.

## 📌 Notes

- Shared links encode data directly in the URL  
- Nothing is stored anywhere
- If you refresh without the link… yeah, it’s gone 😅
